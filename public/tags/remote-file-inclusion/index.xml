      <description>File Inclusion Introduction File inclusion vulnerabilities are of two types: Remote File Inclusion (RFI) and Local File Inclusion (LFI). RFI is said to be present when a web application allows remote users to load and execute a remote file on the server. LFI is said to be present when a web application allows remote users to load any pre-existing file and execute it on the server.
These vulnerabilities are often found in poorly written and/or deployed web applications which loads files or content to display it to the end-user, completely forgetting that this input could be modified.</description>
