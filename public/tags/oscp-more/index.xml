      <description>HackTheBox - Bart Writeup w/o Metasploit Introduction Bart is a retired Windows machine from HackTheBox. It has been rated as a medium difficulty machine, as it requires you to spend a good amount of time to enumerate but the exploiting part is not so hard.
We are presented with just one service - HTTP, consists of three different sites, we abuse a user enumeration functionality for first login, we perform some OSINT to get around the next login, and then abuse a &amp;ldquo;LFI&amp;rdquo; vulnerability to poison the logs.</description>

      <description>HackTheBox - Falafel Writeup w/o Metasploit Introduction Falafel is a retired HackTheBox machine and one of the most interesting machines I have hacked on the platform. It is a Linux machine with some really fun vulnerabilities to exploit. The machine is rated hard but the author was kind enough to give us hints as we hack through it. The machine requires you to know a range of nuances from SQLi to Linux filesystems.</description>
