      <description>HackTheBox - Bart Writeup w/o Metasploit Introduction Bart is a retired Windows machine from HackTheBox. It has been rated as a medium difficulty machine, as it requires you to spend a good amount of time to enumerate but the exploiting part is not so hard.
We are presented with just one service - HTTP, consists of three different sites, we abuse a user enumeration functionality for first login, we perform some OSINT to get around the next login, and then abuse a &amp;ldquo;LFI&amp;rdquo; vulnerability to poison the logs.</description>

      <description>HackTheBox - Bashed Writeup w/o Metasploit Introduction Bashed is a retired HackTheBox machine, rated easy and rightfully so. We go from finding a hidden web shell to quickly gaining root due to over privileged users. I present a small discussion at the end of the write-up that I had with some folks on what steps could be taken to secure something like this on a corporate level, not really necessary but fun.</description>

      <description>HackTheBox - Lame Writeup w/o Metasploit Introduction Lame was the first machine on the HackTheBox platform, it is very much like any other Boot2Root machine but is good for beginners. Lame is a Linux machine and has rightfully rated as Easy by the platform. There are 2 ways to own the machine and a false positive which may or may not lead to a rabbit hole, depending on the way you approach it.</description>

      <description>HackTheBox - Falafel Writeup w/o Metasploit Introduction Falafel is a retired HackTheBox machine and one of the most interesting machines I have hacked on the platform. It is a Linux machine with some really fun vulnerabilities to exploit. The machine is rated hard but the author was kind enough to give us hints as we hack through it. The machine requires you to know a range of nuances from SQLi to Linux filesystems.</description>

      <description>HackTheBox - Cronos Writeup w/o Metasploit Introduction Cronos is a HackTheBox retired machine. It is a Linux box, and has been officially rated as medium in difficulty, although I feel the machine is quite easy. Let&amp;rsquo;s jump in.
